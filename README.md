## About Me

A Computer Science graduate from IIT Delhi, I am passionate about leading teams in designing and developing technical systems that impact people.

A _avid reader_, _long distance runner_ and a firm believer in _multi-disciplinary learning_.

## My Philosophy

**Actions define outcome** <br>

People are not born great, passion and hard work make them.
