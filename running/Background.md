# Background

Life is a play. Play is a child. 

Childhood was a time of boundless energy, and for me, it was channeled into the world of play. Cricket, with its enchanting allure, cast a spell on me from an early age. No matter how late the sun hung in the sky, it was a difficult task for my parents to summon me back from the fields, where I was perpetually engrossed in the game. It wasn't just the skill that fascinated me; it was the endurance of bowling, of fielding that attracted me towards the game.

While I might not have been the fittest child among my peers, my determination knew no bounds. I'd persevere on the cricket pitch until sheer exhaustion overtook me, and then I'd find that extra ounce of strength to keep going. Bowling was my poison, and at multiple occassions was running down the school corridors, crafting my perfect delivery to an imaginary batsman, using an imaginary ball made of air.

Running, however, was a different story. The tedium of a 1600-meter lap was enough to extinguish any lingering enthusiasm for track and field. I sprinted away from that chapter of my life, and running was a thing of the past.

As I grew older, the gravitational pull of academia and the aspiration to secure a place at the prestigious IIT became my focal point. The playing began to recede into the background as my life was increasingly spent within four walls, surrounded by textbooks and stacks of paper.

I did eventually achieve my goal and entered the hallowed halls of IIT Delhi. But my penchant for staying isolated, coupled with a growing indifference toward play, followed me. In my first year, I did make an attempt to return to the cricket pitch and even secured a spot on the hostel squad. However, just before the crucial match, I succumbed to self-doubt, choosing to watch from the sidelines as my replacement took my place in the game.

Sixteen long years would pass before I'd allow myself to seriously entertain the thought of playing again. But when that moment arrived, I embraced it with open arms. The game of life was about to reveal its next chapter, and this time, I was ready to step up to the crease, ready to play like never before.
