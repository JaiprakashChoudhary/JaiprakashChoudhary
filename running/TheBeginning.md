# The Beginning

Running is an art, and you are the artist.

When I went for the first run, I had no idea of what I was getting into. It started with full enthusiasm, but the energy was soon over at only around 100mts. Then started the slow walk, with intermittent tries to run. It ended into a distance of approximately 4kms at a snail pace, almost equal to a walking speed.

Though the run was not as I had hoped, but the fulfilment was something that I would continue to go after. The body was paining at all places. Having being asked a tough question, it had no answer to, it reverted it to the default answer it had, pain. 

Even amongst all the pain, I held on to the feeling of accomplishing something, and with it, went the next day for another run. I would now continue to do this almost every day. It started by creating smaller milestones, just completing a 10k, then a 15k, then it was burning 1000 kcal etc. These smaller acheivable milestones helped boost the momentum. The next one would seem just around the corner, and would wake me up at the right time to go after it.

At the same time, I also started consuming a lot of information on the best way to approach running and the methods to improve. A lot of the information is captured here, along with my learnings on applying the information.
