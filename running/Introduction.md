# Introduction

Every runner has a story. In each story hidden is the meaning of life.

It is year 2021, and the world is still reeling from the harrowing grasp of the Covid-19 pandemic. Having witnessed the relentless specter of death that swept across the globe, many of us were forced to confront our own mortality, pondering the path that lay ahead. This introspection kindled an insatiable quest for meaning and purpose in life, a journey that continued to unfold.

The ephemeral nature of life is a truth we often acknowledge but seldom embrace, until it abruptly confronts us through the loss of someone dear. With time, those heart-wrenching moments fade, and we move on, seemingly unaffected. Yet, for me, something changed. A vow was made, an oath to remember the fragility of existence and to seize control over the final chapters of this earthly tale.

With newfound clarity, an extraordinary resolve emerged: to script the closing lines of one's own narrative on my own terms, to defy the capricious whims of fate. No longer willing to accept a fate met in the shadows, whether it be a silent night's heart attack or the sterile confines of a hospital room, a decision was made. It was time to reclaim ownership over one's body, one's health, and to embark on an extraordinary journey â€“ a journey that began with a single step, with the decision to run.

This is a story of transformation, of seizing control, and of the relentless pursuit of the elusive meaning of life. It is a journey which transcends the boundaries of self-discovery and grapples with the universal truths of existence. It is a tale of self-discovery, resilience, and the pursuit of a life lived on one's own terms, a journey that would come to reveal not only the profound depths of human potential but also the extraordinary capacity for personal growth and renewal.
