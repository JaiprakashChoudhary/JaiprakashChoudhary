### Reporting infrastructure
* A pipeline to read data from multiple services
* The data is dumped in raw format
* ETL jobs of Spark execute to create processed data
* Presto jobs for dynamic data processing 
* Scheduled jobs over airflow
* Json file parser which reads queries and sample excel
* Query output processed in excel files and email sent
* Parser developed for configuration based scheduling
* On demand reports panel developed with roles and permissions
* Reports requested pipelined in queue
* Support for throttling at user and groups level
* Basis load of system, reports pipelined
* Parser based submission for easier onboarding of new projects
